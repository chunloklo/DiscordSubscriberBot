## Discord Subscriber Announcement Chat Bot
Allows Discord users within the same channel to subscribe to lists to allow organizers to easily announce to a selective group of the server.

Built using Python and the Discord API, the Discord Subscriber Announcement Chat Bot aims to allow users within the heterogeous communities of large servers to easily announce information only to those relevant. Using a simple backend database, it allows users to subscribe to certain announcements tags and allows organizers to easily call out to those subscribed by putting users on lists. Users can easily add different subscription channels and unsubscribe to them as they please. Check out the project on github to download.

### Usage
To get the bot to work, you must create your own Discord chat bot and insert your bot's ID and token into line 60 and 208 respectively

After the bot starts, type !help for the list of commands.
If double-clicking the python script does not work, try executing it through the command line.
